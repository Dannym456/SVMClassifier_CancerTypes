# SVMClassifier_CancerTypes
Small sample code of using Support Vector Machines to help classify cancer types. This was done for a school assignment. I am trying to predict on two lung cancer types in this project with lncRNA expression Values. LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma). I also show ROC/AUC in action here to get a better understanding of our predictions.
